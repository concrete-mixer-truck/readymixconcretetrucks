A confluence of two watercourses during which a tributary stream is prevented by levees, natural or artificial, from immediately joining one other stream or river and consequently is forced to move parallel beside it, normally inside a large floodplain, for a substantial distance before the channels eventually merge, typically at the convex bend of a big meander. It is formed from the deposition of the sediment carried by the river as the move leaves the mouth of the river. An arc-shaped, dune-like mound of sediment on a seaside or foreshore. Cusps are usually uniformly spaced in repeating patterns near the shoreline, with the embayment of each arc made of fantastic-grained sand or gravel and the "horns" made of coarser sediment.</p><p>Any natural process by which material reminiscent of soil and rocks is added to a landform or landmass, e.g. by the motion of wind, water, ice, or gravity in transporting previously weathered floor material, which comes to rest when ample kinetic vitality is misplaced and accumulates in layers of sediment. A conspicuous orange-yellow to black coating typically current on uncovered rock surfaces in arid environments, consisting of skinny, laborious, polished layers of metal oxides, especially iron and manganese, which kind when minute quantities of matter migrate to the floor of the rock by capillary action and are then precipitated by evaporation. 1. A deep crack, fissure, or chasm within the ice of a glacier or ice sheet, or extra usually in any floor floor. Cut banks generally kind on the skin bend of a deep meander, reverse the depositional level bar that varieties on the inside bend. Another name for a valley. A small, secluded hollow, normally inside a grassy, park-like, partially wooded valley. A small, intermittent stream that is larger than a brook but smaller than a river.</p><p>A frequently eroding bank alongside a meandering river or stream channel, especially a financial institution that has been eroded right into a nearly vertical cliff. The totality of water within the strong part on the Earth's surface, together with glaciers; sea, lake, and river ice; snow; and permafrost. A landform at the mouth of a river the place the primary stem splits up into several distributaries. The core of the aggregate pile remained cool even as the weather warmed - an additional support in controlling mix temperature. Aggregate base is often composed of crushed rock able to passing through a 20-millimetre (3?4 in) rock display screen. A pillar of rock weathered from volcanic breccia or similar materials and capped by a big boulder which has protected the fabric beneath.
