Naomi raised her pistol and took a potshot at the facility, only to see that the shield had been positioned in such a means that it enveloped both the power and Morgan.

Had the voice come from outdoors his head, Morgan suspected that it might have deafened him.  You might finish this easily sufficient,  Morgan supplied.  You ought to have told us,  Sid rumbled.
